🌊🚨 Logo Design | AquaTunnel – Smart Flood Alert System
As part of my internship design task 2, I had the opportunity to conceptualize and design a logo for a new company idea. I chose AquaTunnel — a smart flood-alert system focused on tunnel safety.
 
💭 Design Process:
🔷 1. Brand Name & Vision:
 AquaTunnel stands for water-aware tunnel infrastructure. The company focuses on protecting underground tunnels and roads from flooding by using real-time sensors and alert systems.
🔷 2. Conceptual Symbolism:
 The logo visually merges:
A tunnel arc formed by 3 semi-circles.
Blue waves to represent floodwaters.
A blend of tech + environment awareness.
🔷 3. Font Choice:
 Used a hand-brushed typeface to reflect natural flow and human-centric design. The capital “T” doubles as a visual bridge or pipe, reinforcing the tunnel theme.
🔷 4. Color Psychology:
Black for strength and seriousness (infrastructure, alerts)
Blue for water, trust, and calmness — a key emotion in critical situations
 
🛠️ Tools Used:
Canva for layout and design
Handpicked icons and custom placement for alignment and visual hierarchy

🌱 Final Thought:
This logo reflects the intersection of technology, safety, and water awareness. It was a great learning experience to convert a functional concept into a visual identity.
